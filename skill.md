description: "Discover and invoke published AIsa tools with the AIsa CLI (search, schema, quote, call) or unified MCP. Use when the user wants AIsa tools or sign-in, or needs current web, company, or social data AIsa tools can fetch—even if they do not name AIsa. Do not use for OpenClaw Chinese model provider setup (aisa-provider), installing other catalog skills, or work that does not need live AIsa data."

# AIsa

If you are already reading this skill, continue the current task. Do not reinstall it, reread setup docs, or relogin a working connection.

If the user named another tool, or a dedicated local tool already covers the job, do not force AIsa.

First-time install and connect: https://aisa.one/docs/agent-quickstart.md

## Reuse

Reuse a working official `aisa` skill, `@aisa-one/cli` **0.5.0 or later**, stored CLI credentials, or a unified MCP session. An explicit user transport choice or a still-authorized connection wins. Otherwise prefer the CLI on a user-local machine (PowerShell counts); prefer MCP on Grok Bot or another cloud sandbox even when a terminal exists. `AISA_API_KEY` overrides stored CLI credentials and never refreshes. If they conflict, explain the sources and leave custom setup alone. Never print credentials. Do not read or refresh token or compatibility key files. `aisa whoami` may refresh stored tokens and is not protected auth proof. Search and schema may be anonymous — they are not auth proof.

## Sign-in

Prove CLI auth with `aisa balance`. Before replying to a sign-in message or writing to its terminal, read `aisa login --help`. Follow it to interpret the CLI prompt and relay only the requested authorization result through the existing process. No credit → top up, not “missing key”.

## Workflow

`search` → `schema` when `has_full_schema` is false → `quote` → `call` inside authorized scope and spend. `quote` and `call` share the saved credentials and the same `calls` JSON shape. Take tool IDs and arguments from search/schema. Do not invent IDs or prices. Runtime help, schema, and quote are authoritative. `--input` is inline JSON:

```sh
aisa search --input '{"query":"<user goal>"}' --json
aisa quote --input '{"calls":[{"call_id":"c1","tool":"<name from search>","arguments":{}}]}' --json
```

Quote does not execute and is not approval to execute. A missing, failed, or partial quote is not free and is not a full-batch total or cap. Estimated cost is not a cap. Setup is not paid execution permission. Reuse a still-valid explicit authorization; do not invent confirmation loops for search, schema, or install. Re-quote if tools, arguments, or scope change. Do not silently retry or expand the batch.

## MCP

Use native remote Streamable HTTP MCP with OAuth at `https://tools.aisa.one/mcp`. No CLI, npm, npx, or Skill installation is required; already-installed guidance may be used. The client owns browser sign-in and tokens. Do not treat domain MCP or `aisa connect`’s default web-search server as this router. Discovery or a 401 is not a protected call. If a connector cannot be added, give the user that endpoint and one next action; do not claim connected.

| MCP tool | CLI command |
| --- | --- |
| `AISA_SEARCH_TOOL` | `aisa search` |
| `AISA_BATCH_GET_SCHEMA` | `aisa schema` |
| `AISA_BATCH_QUOTE` | `aisa quote` |
| `AISA_BATCH_USE` | `aisa call` |
