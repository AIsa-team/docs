# Independent dev documentation

## Branch and hosting ownership

| Environment | Source branch | Hosting |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Production | `main` | Existing Mintlify project at `https://aisa.one/docs` |
| Development | `dev` | A separate Mintlify project connected only to `dev` |

A push to `dev` can update the dev documentation without merging to `main`.
Mintlify's GitHub App publishes the branch selected in each project's Git
settings. There is no GitHub Actions site upload, Docker image, or server
deployment command in this repository. The existing production project must
continue to track `main`.

## Connect the dev site

1. In Mintlify, create a separate project for dev. Select the existing
   `AIsa-team/docs` repository, deployment branch `dev`, and repository root as
   the content directory (`docs.json` is at the root).
2. Verify the new project's default `*.mintlify.app` URL before adding a custom
   domain. Add the dev domain to this new project only and configure the exact
   DNS records shown by Mintlify. A dedicated subdomain can serve docs at `/`;
   it does not need the production website's `/docs` proxy.
3. Push a documentation change to `dev`. Check the `Docs checks` and `Dev docs`
   workflows, then the new project's deployment history and deployed content.
   Mintlify deployment status is independent of these Actions checks; required
   PR checks should be configured on `dev` if changes need review before publish.
4. Verify the production project still tracks `main` and has not published the
   dev commit. Keep the dev branch: it is the persistent source for the dev site.

Preview deployments are an alternative for temporary reviews, but they do not
support custom domains. Use a separate project for a stable dev domain. Project
availability and billing depend on the Mintlify account's plan.

## Repository automation boundaries

`docs-checks.yml` validates navigation, generated endpoint slugs and links on
both `main` and `dev`. `dev-docs.yml` runs the existing composition and
publication regression tests and frozen acceptance fixtures offline on dev
pushes and PRs targeting dev. It has read-only repository permissions, no App
credentials, no production Runtime acquisition, no shared source-review cache,
and no downstream notifications.

These production workflows require `refs/heads/main`, including manual runs:

- `pull-openapi.yml`: acquire and formally publish production Runtime contracts.
- `sync-openapi.yml`: legacy OpenAPI publication and production notifications.
- `refresh-upstream.yml`: production upstream maintenance and review PRs.
- `check-contract-revisions.yml`: production consumer convergence checks.
- `dispatch-contract-consumers.yml`: notify Tool Router, website and MCP.
- `read-merged-input-qualification.yml`: existing main-only diagnostic reader.

Production artifact assessment in `test-runtime-contracts.yml` runs on `main`
and PRs targeting `main`. A manual run from dev cannot acquire live production
evidence. The offline code test job remains usable from other branches.

Consumer dispatch also verifies that its full input commit SHA is reachable
from remote `main` before minting downstream credentials. A dev-only commit
cannot be advertised as a production publication. The production publisher's
concurrency group includes the branch, so an accidental dev invocation cannot
hold or cancel the production publication lock.

Pushing `dev` does not automatically publish a new formal contract, regenerate
production receipts, push to `main`, or notify production consumers. Scheduled
workflows continue to run from the repository's default branch (`main`). Do not
change the default branch to dev.

## API environment is a separate configuration

This change isolates Git branches, site publication and repository automation.
It does not rewrite existing endpoint contracts or production publication
receipts. The initial dev branch inherits the reviewed content from main,
including production API servers, production website links and console links.
An independent Mintlify project does not automatically change those URLs.

Before using dev docs for API integration, configure the chosen dev addresses
in `docs.json` (`api.mdx.server`, navbar and relevant links), the relevant
OpenAPI `servers`, request examples, and download/discovery links. Do not enable
the production Runtime publisher on dev or relabel a production receipt as dev
evidence. A future dev Runtime sync must explicitly select dev inputs and keep
its publication and notifications separate from the production pipeline.

## Work on dev

```sh
git fetch origin
git switch --track origin/dev
# Edit MDX or other documentation sources.
git add <changed-files>
git commit -m "docs: describe a development change"
git push origin HEAD:dev
```

For local preview, use Node.js 22 and `npx mint@4.2.1006 dev`. The preview defaults
to `http://localhost:3000`. For validation matching Actions:

```sh
python -m pip install 'PyYAML>=6,<7' 'jsonschema>=4.23,<5' 'openapi-spec-validator>=0.7,<0.8'
npm install --prefix /tmp/runtime-yaml-reader --no-audit --no-fund --ignore-scripts js-yaml@4.1.1
export RUNTIME_YAML_READER_MODULE=/tmp/runtime-yaml-reader/node_modules/js-yaml
python scripts/check_nav_integrity.py
python scripts/validate_runtime_api_reference_slugs.py --generated-only
python -m unittest discover -s scripts/tests -v
python scripts/tests/fixtures/w0-package/scripts/api-contract-acceptance/verify.py
python -m unittest discover -s scripts/tests/w3_verification -v
npx --yes mint@4.2.1006 broken-links --files '**/*.mdx' --check-redirects
```
